I used the Version Control system to copy my tic tact toe game project file into the repository. First I created 
a new repository called "cse210" through the interface in my personal account in GitHub, and then I copied it and 
push it the files into that repository. I also learned on a youtube tutorial that git commands 
are important and easy to understand. 
These were the commands I used to push my project:

git init

git add system.txt

git status

git commit -m 'first-commit'

git status

git push
